- take into consideration reviewer's comments
- fix damping coefficients
- normalize coefficients servo model
- longitudinal guidance loop: use nx,z as virtual inputs, transform into pitch angles and thrust command
- add side force generator to extend to second order approaches?
- add figure for guidance frame, sacrifice some other figure?
- make superscripts indicating frames consistent, there are velocities that are simply called "v"
- do final check for typos and layout
