Reviewer 9 of IFAC WC 2017 submission 3367

Comments to the author
======================

It is an interesting open problem which has been made as
the benchmark problem in distributed flight control area.
The following need to be clarified.
1. what does the separation vector, delta p^e_f in equation
(26)?
2. what is omega_p in equation (31)?

to 1): When the (rigid) formation is rotating w.r.t. to the local inertial frame, this induces 
		a velocity that is superimposed on the inertial velocity of the predecessor
to 2): fixed error in computation of guidance frame, thanks reviewer :)
