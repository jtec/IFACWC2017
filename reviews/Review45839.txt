Reviewer 11 of IFAC WC 2017 submission 3367

Comments to the author
======================

This paper presents a benchmark for distributed formation
flight control for UAVs. A set of LQ baseline control laws
is also implemented to provide a standard test case. 
Although the reviewer understand the importance of a
benchmark, it seems to me that the discussion on the
benchmark is insufficient. The reviewer has the following
concerns:
* Some tools including 3D visualization are also presented.
However, it seems important for other researchers to
implement and test their own algorithms easily. The
interface of the tool must also be discussed. 
- It is true that the interface to the UAV3D tool would benefit from online documentation, 
	but it is also true that it is encapsulated in a Simulink block and as such
	can be used in a drop-and-play manner - at least from Simulink. Extending the 
	use of UAV3D to other simulation envionments is clearly not within the scope
	of this article.
* Model of aircraft and trajectory are shown in Section 3
and 4. But the reviewer wonders if it is possible to form
consensus as a widely-used benchmark. It seems better to
devote much space to the effectiveness of them to be used
for the benchmark. 
- Not at all sure what the reviewer intends to say here
