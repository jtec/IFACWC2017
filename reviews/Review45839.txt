Reviewer 11 of IFAC WC 2017 submission 3367

Comments to the author
======================

This paper presents a benchmark for distributed formation
flight control for UAVs. A set of LQ baseline control laws
is also implemented to provide a standard test case. 
Although the reviewer understand the importance of a
benchmark, it seems to me that the discussion on the
benchmark is insufficient. The reviewer has the following
concerns:
* Some tools including 3D visualization are also presented.
However, it seems important for other researchers to
implement and test their own algorithms easily. The
interface of the tool must also be discussed. 
* Model of aircraft and trajectory are shown in Section 3
and 4. But the reviewer wonders if it is possible to form
consensus as a widely-used benchmark. It seems better to
devote much space to the effectiveness of them to be used
for the benchmark.
