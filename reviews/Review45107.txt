Reviewer 10 of IFAC WC 2017 submission 3367

Comments to the author
======================

This is a good paper and I recommend for its acceptance. I
also suggest that the authors prepare a more elaborate
paper and submit it to Control Engineering Practice for
consideration. Such a paper would greatly benefit the
flight control community in general.

Having said that, the following minor corrections should be
done before submitting the final version.

1. Numbers in Eq.(13) should be replaced with symbols (I
guess \gita and \omega_n can be used) and numbers (with
units) can be given for those symbols.
- nice one, done.

2. Reference is needed for Dryden turbulence spectrum below
Eq.(18).
- added ref to MIL-STD-1797A and Matlab/Simulink Aerospace Blockset

3. References should be included for the claim in Paragraph
below Subsection 5.1
- added refs to two examples for guidance frames proposed in the literature.

4. Perhaps the following paper should be cited, which has
proposed close formation flying using the concept of
integrated guidance and control that uses the Six-DOF model
of a fixed-wing UAV:
Formation Flying with Nonlinear Partial Integrated Guidance
and Control, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic
Systems, Vol. 50, No. 4, October 2014, pp. 2847-2859.
 - done, mentioned in conclusion as potential user of the benchmark

5. Last sentence of the paper, i.e. ".....we are currently
evaluating...." should be seriously looked into and rather
be committed for the benefit of the control community.
- ok, working on it
