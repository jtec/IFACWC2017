Comments to the author
======================

The paper presents an open benchmark comprising a nonlinear
six degrees of freedom dynamics model of an electric glider
UAS and a nominal guidance frame that does not require
state information of other UAS. The paper describes in
detail the aircraft model and the simulation environment
and control laws. Simulation results are based on formation
of three UAS for the cases of calm air and with the
presence of turbulent air. Position errors and control
inputs are depicted for each case. Conclusion section
remarks that the simulation results for this particular UAS
formation confirm the expected mesh instability and other
deficiencies of the baseline guidance strategy. 

In order to improve the paper, I would recommend the
authors to briefly compare the proposed benchmark
implementation to other possible related benchmarking
platforms (based on Matlab/Simulink or not), highlighting
pros and cons so that the researchers interested in start
using the proposed benchmark implementation can have a
better criteria to make a choice.
